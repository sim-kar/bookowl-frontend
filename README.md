## General Information
This project is the frontend for the web app [bookowl](https://bookowl.netlify.app/). The backend 
is available in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/sim-kar/bookowl-backend).

The app was built with Angular to provides a user-friendly interface and features a
secure registration and login system. Users can not only discover new books, but also keep track
of their entire reading history, rate books and share reviews, and see what others are reading and 
which books are popular at the moment.

This project aimed to enhance skills in full-stack web development, using the MEAN tech stack 
(MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js). It utilizes a self-developed REST API and also connects to an 
external API in GoogleBooks for extended functionality.
